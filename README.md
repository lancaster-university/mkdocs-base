# MKDOCS-BASE

This repository contains a base theme, and some example documentation to get started with documenting a CODAL device.

## Installation

To generate a working site, [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) must be used:

`pip install mkdocs`

Executing mkdocs serve in the root directory should render a working website in your web browser.

## Applying this to a codal device

Simply copy the docs, theme and mkdocs.yml files to your target repository, and begin writing documentation. Any additional resources like pdf files and images for the markdown should be placed in the resources folder.

To set a custom logo image for the site, please use the following yaml config options:
```
extra:
  logo_author: Joe Bloggs
  logo_url: ./img/logo.png
```

`logo_url` should be a path relative to the base of the theme directory.

## Adding C++ documentation.

Normally when generating documentation for C++ projects developers use technologies like doxygen. We are no different in this regard, except that we translate C++ classes to markdown text automatically.

To do this, you can place a special comment inside a .md file:

```
[comment]: <> ({"className":"CodalDevice"})
[comment]: <> ({"end":"CodalDevice"})
```

When documentation generation occurs, the respective class named in these tags will be populated with the C++ documentation generated by doxygen.

To generate, please run:

```
python build.py -g
```

At the top level build folder for CODAL, after selecting your target device.
